The details for this project are in the document "LinkedList.pdf" available on Canvas, on the page "Project 1 - Templated Linked List".

For part 1, you will be implementing the basics of any container:

Ways to add information to the container

AddHead()
AddTail()
AddNodesHead()
AddNodesTail()
A way to get some information about the container

NodeCount()
Ways to see the data in the container

PrintForward()
PrintReverse()
And some essentials for any class

Default constructor
Destructor (other members of the Big Three will come later)
This project will use the memory leak detection functionality contained in leaker.h and leaker.cpp from the previous assignment. Be sure to delete all of the container's nodes in the destructor!
